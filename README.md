**Soil-erosion-estimation**
To estimate potential zones of soil erosion in Kheda district of Gujarat using RUSLE model equation  
The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation used to estimate average annual soil erosion potential,
A=R×K×L×S×C×P...(1)
Where,
A = computed average annual soil loss (tons/ha/year), R = rainfall-runoff erosivity factor, K soil erodibility factor, L = slope length factor, S= slope steepness factor, C = cover-management factor, P= conservation practice factor

We take the study area of Kheda district, which spans an area of 719400 ha (3953 sq.km) and it is located at coordinates 72.68’ E longitude and 22.75’ N latitude. The study area is at altitude of 20 to 25m from mean sea level.
